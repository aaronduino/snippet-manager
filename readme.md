_The dead-simple snippet manager_

After trying countless snippet managers, I've finally decided that what I need is something that is _fast_ (and _quick to use_), _dead simple_, and _reliable_.

The result? This.

## Development
(you are going to do all the following in the `src/` directory)


Installing dependencies:
```
npm install
```

Running the source code:
```
npm start
```

Building:
```
npm run build
```

Builds the app for macOS, Linux, and Windows, using [electron-packager](https://github.com/electron-userland/electron-packager).
